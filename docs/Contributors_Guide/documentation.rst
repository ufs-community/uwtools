Documentation Overview
======================

The majority of the documentation is created using the Sphinx documentation
generator tool, which was originally created for Python documentation.  The
documentation is created using reStructuredText (reST). This
`link <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_
provides a brief introduction to reST concepts and syntax. It is intended to give
authors enough information to create and modify the documents productively.
