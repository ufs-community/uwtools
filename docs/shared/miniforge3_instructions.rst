This recipe uses the ``aarch64`` (64-bit ARM) Miniforge for Linux, and installs into ``$HOME/conda``. Adjust as necessary for your target system.

1. Download, install, and activate the latest :miniforge3:`Miniforge<>` for your system. If an existing conda (:miniforge:`Miniforge<>`, :miniconda:`Miniconda<>`, :anaconda:`Anaconda<>`, etc.) installation is available and writable, you may activate that and skip this step and continue on to the next.
