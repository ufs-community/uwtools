Fork and PR Model
=================

Contributions to the ``workflow-tools`` project are made via `Forks <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks>`_ and `PRs <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>`_. GitHub provides a thorough description of this contribution model in their `_Contributing to projects_ Quickstart <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects>`_, but the steps, with respect to ``workflow-tools`` contributions, can be summarized as:

#. `Fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#forking-a-repository>`_ the ``workflow-tools`` `repository <https://github.com/ufs-community/workflow-tools>`_ repo into your personal GitHub space.
#. `Clone <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#cloning-a-fork>` your fork onto your development system.
#. `Create a branch <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#creating-a-branch-to-work-on>`_ for your changes in your clone.
#. `Make, commit, and push changes <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-and-pushing-changes>`_ in your clone, to your fork.
#. When your work is complete, `create a pull request <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request>`_ to merge your changes, targeting the ``develop`` branch of the ``workflow-tools`` repo.

A default set of reviewers will automatically be added to your PR, but feel free to add others, if appropriate.

When creating the PR, please follow these guidelines specific to the ``workflow-tools`` project:

* Complete the template that you will find the `Description` section pre-populated with. Provide an informative synopsis of your contribution, then mark appropriate checklist items by placing an ``x`` between their square brackets. You may tidy up the description by removing boilerplate text and non-selected checklist items.
* Ensure that your PR is targeting ``ufs-community/workflow-tools`` as the base repository and ``develop`` as the base branch.
* Use the pull-down arrow on the green button below the description to initially create a `Draft pull request <https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/>`_.
* Once the draft PR is open, visit its `Files changed` tab and add comments on any lines of code that you think reviewers will benefit from. Try to save time by proactively answering questions you suspect reviewers will ask.
* Once your draft PR is marked up with you comments, return to the `Conversation` tab and click the `Ready for review` button.

Reviews may make comments, ask questions, or request changes on your PR. Respond to these as needed, making commits in your clone and pushing to your fork/branch. The PR will automatically be updated when commits are pushed to its source branch in your fork, so reviewers will immediately see your updates.

A PR is ready to merge when:

#. It has been approved by a required number of ``workflow-tools`` core-developer reviewers.
#. All conversations have been marked as resolved.
#. All required checks have passed.

These criteria and their current statuses are detailed in a section at the bottom of the PR's `Conversation` tab. Checks take some time to run, so please be patient.

If you have write access to the ``workflow-tools`` repo, you may merge your PR yourself once the above conditions are met. If not, a ``workflow-tools`` core developer will perform the merge for you.

Please use the PR comments to ask for help with any difficulties you encounter using this procedure!
