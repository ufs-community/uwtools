Fork and PR Model
=================

Contributions to the ``workflow-tools`` project are made via `Forks <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks>`_ and `PRs <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>`_. GitHub provides a thorough description of this contribution model in their `_Contributing to projects_ Quickstart <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects>`_, but the steps, with respect to ``workflow-tools`` contributions, can be summarized as:

#. `Fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#forking-a-repository>`_ the ``workflow-tools`` `repository <https://github.com/ufs-community/workflow-tools>`_ repo into your personal GitHub space.
#. `Clone <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#cloning-a-fork>` your fork onto your development system.
#. `Create a branch <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#creating-a-branch-to-work-on>`_ for your changes in your clone.
#. `Make, commit, and push changes <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-and-pushing-changes>`_ in your clone, to your fork.
#. When your work is complete, `create a pull request <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request>`_ to merge your changes, targeting the ``develop`` branch of the ``workflow-tools`` repo.


When creating a ``workflow-tools`` PR, you will find the _Description_ section pre-populated with a template for you to fill in. Provide an informative description, then mark appropriate checklist items by placing an ``x`` marks between their square brackets. You may tidy up the description by removing boilerplate text and non-selected checklist items.

A default set of reviewers will automatically be added to your PR, but feel free to add others, if appropriate.

A PR is ready to merge when:

#. It has been approved by a required number of ``workflow-tools`` core-developer reviewers.
3. All conversations have been marked as resolved.
#. All required checks have passed.

These criteria and their current status are detailed in a section at the bottom of the PR's _Conversation_ tab
