=============

Locally Building and Previewing Documentation
---------------------------------------------

To locally build the docs:

#. Obtain a development shell as described in the :doc:`Developer Setup <developer_setup>` section.
#. From the root of your clone: ``cd docs``
#. Install the required doc packages: ``source install-deps``
#. Build the docs: ``make docs``

The ``make docs`` command will build the docs under ``docs/build/html``, after which you can preview them in your web browser at the URL

.. code-block:: text

  file://<filesystem-path-to-your-clone>/docs/build/html/index.index.html

Re-run ``make docs`` and refresh your browser after making and saving changes.

If, at some point, you remove and recreate the conda development environment underlying your development shell, you will need to re-run the ``source install-deps`` command in the new environment/shell. Until then, the installed doc packages will persist and support docs generation.

Viewing Online Documentation
----------------------------

Online documentation generation and hosting for ``uwtools`` is provided by :rtd:`Read the Docs<>`. The green *View Docs* button near the upper right of that page links to the official docs for the project, as built for the ``main`` branch. Docs are also generated for the ``develop`` branch, and can be selected by changing **v: main** to **v: develop** via the small green pull-down menu located at the bottom of the navigation pane on the left of the page.

Docs are also built and published when Pull Requests (PRs) targeting the ``develop`` or ``main`` branches are opened. Visit the :rtd:`Builds page<builds>` to see recent builds, including those made for PRs. Click a PR-related build marked *Passed*, then the small *View docs* link (**not** the large green *View Docs* button) to see the docs built specifically for that PR. If your PR includes documentation updates, it may be helpful to include the URL of this build in your PR's description so that reviewers can see the rendered HTML docs and not just the modified ``.rst`` files. Note that, if commits are pushed to the PR's source branch, Read the Docs will rebuild the PR docs: See the checks section near the bottom of a PR for current status, and for another link to the PR docs via the *Details* link.

Documentation Guidelines
------------------------

Please follow these guidelines when contributing to the documentation:

* Ensure that the ``make docs`` command completes with no errors or warnings.
* If the link-check portion of ``make docs`` reports that a URL is ``permanently`` redirected, update the link in the docs to use the new URL. Non-permanent redirects can be left as-is.
* Do not manually wrap lines in the ``.rst`` files. Insert newlines only as needed to achieve correctly formatted HTML, and let HTML wrap long lines and/or provide a scrollbar.
* Indent ``.. code-block::`` directives 2 spaces per nesting level to achieve the required alignment. For example, indent 0 spaces for code blocks that should align with text on the left margin, and 2 spaces for code blocks that should align with bulleted or numbered list text. Indent actual code 2 **extra** spaces under the ``.. code-block::`` directive.
* Use one blank line between documentation elements (headers, paragraphs, code blocks, etc.) unless additional lines are necessary to achieve correctly formatted HTML.
* Remove all trailing whitespace.
* In general, avoid pronouns like "we" and "you". (Using "we" may be appropriate when synonymous with "The UW Team", "The UFS Community", etc., when the context is clear.) Prefer direct, factual statements about what the code does, requires, etc.
* The synopsis information printed by ``uw [mode [submode]] --help`` is automatically wrapped and indented based on current terminal size. For visual consistency, please set your terminal width to 100 columns when running such commands to produce output to copy into the docs.
* Follow the :rst:`RST Sections<basics.html#sections>` guidelines, underlining section headings with = characters, subsections with - characters, and subsubsections with ^ characters. If a further level of refinement is needed, use " to underline paragraph headers.
* Keep formatting consistent across pages.
* In [[sub]sub]section titles, capitalize all "principal" words. In practice this usually means all words but articles (a, an, the), logicals (and, etc.), and prepositions (for, of, etc.). Always fully capitalize acronyms (e.g., YAML).
* Never capitalize proper names when their owners do not (e.g. write `"pandas" <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, not "Pandas", even at the start of a sentence) or when referring to a software artifact (e.g. write ``numpy`` when referring to the library, and "NumPy" when referring to the project).
