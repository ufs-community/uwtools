WIP

* Ensure that the ``make html`` command completes with no errors or warnings.
* Do not manually wrap lines. Insert newlines only as needed to achieve correctly formatted HTML, and let HTML handle wrapping long lines.
* Indent ``.. code::`` directives 2 spaces per nesting level to achieve the required alignment. For example, 0 spaces for code blocks that should be aligned with text on the left margin, 2 spaces for code blocks that should align under bulleted or numbered list text. Indent actual code 2 **extra** spaces under the ``.. code::`` directive.
