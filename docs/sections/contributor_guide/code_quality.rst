Code Quality
============

In an active development shell, the following ``make`` targets are available and act on all ``.py`` files under ``src/``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 85
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - Description
   * - ``make format``
     - Formats code with :black:`black<>`, imports with :isort:`isort<>`, docstrings with :docformatter:`docformatter<>`, and ``.jsonschema`` documents with :jq:`jq<>`
   * - ``make lint``
     - Lints code with :pylint:`pylint<>`
   * - ``make typecheck``
     - Typechecks code with :mypy:`mypy<>`
   * - ``make unittest``
     - Runs unit tests and reports coverage with :pytest:`pytest<>` and :coverage:`coverage<>`
   * - ``make test``
     - Equivalent to ``make lint && make typecheck && make unittest``, plus checks defined CLI scripts.

Configuration for these tools is provided by the file ``src/pyproject.toml``.

The order of the targets above is intentional:

   * ``make format`` will complain about certain kinds of syntax errors that would cause all the remaining code-quality tools to fail (and may change line numbers reported by other tools, if it ran after them).
   * ``make lint`` provides a good first check for obvious errors and anti-patterns in the code.
   * ``make typecheck`` offers a more nuanced look at interfaces between functions, methods, etc. and may spot issues missed by the linter.
   * ``make unittest`` provides higher-level semantic-correctness checks once code syntax and typing is deemed correct.

All the above tests are executed by the CI system when code is merged to specific git branches, and again when a conda package is built for release. To ensure that these processes succeed, be sure to run all the tests in a development shell before opening a pull request, and throughout the PR's lifecycle as subsequent changes are made. CI will reject unformatted code, so also run ``make format`` and commit any changes it makes. A useful development idiom is to periodically run ``make format && make test`` to perform a full code-quality sweep through the code.

The ``uwtools`` repository has standardized on 100% unit-test coverage, enforced by ``make unittest`` and its configuration in ``pyproject.toml``. Please help maintain this high standard.
