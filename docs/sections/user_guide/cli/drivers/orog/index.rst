``orog``
========

.. include:: ../shared/idempotent.rst

The ``uw`` mode for configuring and running the UFS Utils preprocessing component ``orog``.

.. include:: help.rst

Examples
^^^^^^^^

The examples use a configuration file named ``config.yaml`` with contents similar to:

.. highlight:: yaml
.. literalinclude:: /shared/orog.yaml

Its contents are described in section :ref:`orog_yaml`.

* Run ``orog`` on an interactive node

  .. code-block:: text

     $ uw orog run --config-file config.yaml

  The driver creates a ``runscript.orog`` file in the directory specified by ``rundir:`` in the config and runs it, executing ``orog``.

* Run ``orog`` via a batch job

  .. code-block:: text

     $ uw orog run --config-file config.yaml --batch

  The driver creates a ``runscript.orog`` file in the directory specified by ``rundir:`` in the config and submits it to the batch system. Running with ``--batch`` requires a correctly configured ``platform:`` block in ``config.yaml``, as well as appropriate settings in the ``execution:`` block under ``orog:``.

* Specifying the ``--dry-run`` flag results in the driver logging messages about actions it would have taken, without actually taking any.

  .. code-block:: text

     $ uw orog run --config-file config.yaml --batch --dry-run
