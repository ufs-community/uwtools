Structured YAML to run the component ``orog`` is validated by JSON Schema and requires the ``orog:`` block, described below. If ``orog`` is to be run via a batch system, the ``platform:`` block, described :ref:`here <platform_yaml>`, is also required.

Documentation for the UFS Utils ``orog`` program is :ufs-utils:`here <orog>`.

Here is a prototype UW YAML ``orog:`` block, explained in detail below:
