filter_topo
===========

Structured YAML to run the component ``filter_topo`` is validated by JSON Schema and requires the ``filter_topo:`` block, described below. If ``filter_topo`` is to be run via a batch system, the ``platform:`` block, described :ref:`here <platform_yaml>`, is also required.

Documentation for the UFS Utils ``filter_topo`` program is :ufs-utils:`here <orog-gsl>`.

Here is a prototype UW YAML ``filter_topo:`` block, explained in detail below:
