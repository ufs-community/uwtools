Structured YAML to configure WaveWatchIII as part of a compiled coupled executable is validated by JSON Schema and requires the ``ww3:`` block, described below.

Here is a prototype UW YAML ``ww3:`` block, explained in detail below:

.. highlight:: yaml
.. literalinclude:: ../../../../shared/ww3.yaml

UW YAML for the ``ww3:`` Block
------------------------------

namelist:
^^^^^^^^^

  .. important:: The WaveWatchIII namelist file is provisioned by rendering an input template file containing Jinja2 expressions. Unlike namelist files provisioned by ``uwtools`` for other components, the WaveWatchIII namelist file will not be validated.

  **template_file:**

  The path to the input template file containing Jinja2 expressions (perhaps named ``ww3_shel.nml.IN``), based on the ``ww3_shel.nml`` file from the WaveWatchIII build. Note that the non-namelist ``ww3_shel.inp`` file may not be used as the basis for the input template file.

  **template_values:**

  Key-value pairs necessary to render all Jinja2 expressions in the input template file named by ``template_file:``.

rundir:
^^^^^^^

The path to the run directory.
