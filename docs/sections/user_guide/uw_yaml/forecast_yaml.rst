.. _forecast_yaml:

Forecast YAML
=============

The structured YAML to run a forecast is described below. It is enforced via JSON Schema.

In this block, there are entries that define where the forecast will run (``run_directory:``), what will run (``executable:``), the data files that should be staged (``cycle_dependent:`` and ``static:``), and blocks that correspond to the configuration files required by the forecast model (``fd_ufs:``, ``field_table:``, ``namelist:``, etc.). Each of the configuration file blocks will allow the user to set a template file as input, or to define a configuration file in its native key/value pair format with an option to update the values (``update_values:``) contained in the original input file (``base_file:``).

The configuration files required by the UFS Weather Model are documented :weather-model-io:`here<model-configuration-files>`.

The ``forecast:`` block
-----------------------

This section describes the specifics of the FV3 atmosphere forecast component.

.. _updating_values:

Updating Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many of the blocks describe configuration files needed by the UFS Weather Model, i.e. ``namelist:``, ``fd_ufs:``, ``model_configure:``. The ``base_file:`` entry in a given block is required to initially stage the file; it can then be modified via an ``update_values:`` block.

To ensure the correct values are updated, the hierarchy of entries in the base file must be mirrored under the ``update_values:`` block. Multiple entries within a block may be updated and they need not follow the same order as those in the base file. For example, the base file named ``people.yaml`` may contain:

.. code-block:: yaml

   person:
     age: 19
     address:
       city: Boston
       number: 12
       state: MA
       street: Acorn St
     name: Jane

Then the entries in the ``update_values:`` YAML block would override this base file with the entries:

.. code-block:: yaml

   base_file: people.yaml
   update_values:
     person:
       address:
         street: Main St
         number: 99

The contents of the staged ``people.yaml`` that results:

.. code-block:: yaml

   person:
     age: 19
     address:
       city: Boston
       number: 99
       state: MA
       street: Main St
     name: Jane


UW YAML Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``cycle_dependent:``
""""""""""""""""""""

This block contains a set of files to stage in the run directory: File names as they appear in the run directory are keys and their source paths are the values. Source paths can be provided as a single string path, or a list of paths to be staged in a common directory under their original names.

  .. warning:: The current version does not support adding cycle information to the content of the files, and this information must be hard-coded in the YAML file.

``diag_table:``
"""""""""""""""

The path to the input Jinja2 template for the ``diag_table`` file.

The diag_table is described :weather-model-io:`here<diag-table-file>`.

``domain:``
"""""""""""

A switch to differentiate between a global or regional configuration. Accepted values are ``global`` and ``regional``.

``executable:``
"""""""""""""""

The path to the compiled executable.

``fd_ufs:``
""""""""""""

This block requires a ``base_file:`` entry that contains the path to the YAML file. An optional ``update_values:`` block may be provided to update any values contained in the base file. Please see the :ref:`updating_values` section for providing information in these entries.

The ``fd_ufs.yaml`` file is a structured YAML used by the FV3 weather model. The tested version can be found in the :ufs-weather-model:`ufs-weather-model repository<blob/develop/tests/parm/fd_ufs.yaml>`. The naming convention for the dictionary entries are documented :cmeps:`here<>`.

``field_table:``
""""""""""""""""

The block requires a ``base_file:`` entry that contains the path to the YAML file. An optional ``update_values:`` block may be provided to update any values contained in the base file. Please see the :ref:`updating_values` section for providing information in these entries.

If a predefined field table (i.e., not a configurable YAML) is to be used, include it in the ``static:`` block.

The documentation for the ``field_table`` file is :weather-model-io:`here<field-table-file>`. Information on how to structure the UW YAML for configuring a ``field_table`` is in the :ref:`defining_a_field_table` Section.

``length:``
"""""""""""

The length of the forecast in hours.

``model_configure:``
""""""""""""""""""""

The block requires a ``base_file:`` entry that contains the path to the YAML file. An optional ``update_values:`` block may be provided to update any values contained in the base file. Please see the :ref:`updating_values` section for providing information in these entries.

The documentation for the ``model_configure`` file is :weather-model-io:`here<model-configure-file>`.

``namelist:``
"""""""""""""

The block requires a ``base_file:`` entry that contains the path to the namelist file. An optional ``update_values:`` block may be provided to update any values contained in the base file. Please see the :ref:`updating_values` section for providing information in these entries.

The documentation for the FV3 namelist, ``input.nml`` is :weather-model-io:`here<namelist-file-input-nml>`.

``run_dir:``
""""""""""""

The path where the forecast input data will be staged and output data will appear after a successful forecast.

``static:``
"""""""""""

This block contains a set of files to stage in the run directory: file names as they appear in the run directory are keys and their source paths are the values. Source paths can be provided as a single string path, or a list of paths to be staged in a common directory under their original names.

``ufs_configure:``

"""""""""""""""""""

The path to the input Jinja2 template for the ``ufs.configure`` file.

The documentation for the ``ufs.configure`` file is :weather-model-io:`here<ufs-configure-file>`.

The ``platform:`` block
-----------------------

This block describes necessary facts about the computational platform.

.. code-block:: yaml

  platform:
    mpicmd: srun # required
    scheduler: slurm

``mpicmd:``
^^^^^^^^^^^
The MPI command used to run the model executable. Typical options are ``srun``, ``mpirun``, ``mpiexec``, etc. System administrators should be able to advise the appropriate choice, if needed.

``scheduler:``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The name of the batch system. Supported options are ``lfs``, ``pbs``, and ``slurm``.

The ``preprocessing:`` block
----------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

  preprocessing:
    lateral_boundary_conditions:
      interval_hours: 3 # optional, default
      offset: 0 # optional, default
      output_file_path: # required

``lateral_boundary_conditions:``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The optional block describes how the lateral boundary conditions have been prepared for a limited-area configuration of the model forecast. It is required for a limited-area forecast. The following entries in its subtree are used for the forecast:

``interval_hours:``
"""""""""""""""""""
The integer number of hours setting how frequently the lateral boundary conditions will be used in the model forecast.

``offset:``
"""""""""""
The integer number of hours setting how many hours earlier the external model used for boundary conditions started compared to the desired forecast cycle.

``output_file_path:``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
The path to the lateral boundary conditions files prepared for the forecast. It accepts the integer ``forecast_hour`` as a Python template, e.g., ``/path/to/srw.t00z.gfs_bndy.tile7.f{forecast_hour:03d}.nc``.

The ``user:`` block
-------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

  user:
    account: my_account # optional

``account:``
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The user account associated with the batch system.
