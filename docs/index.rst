Vision
======

The idea of a unified workflow is to develop a wide array of tools in
object-oriented Python that can be used in all
`Unified Forecast System (UFS) <https://ufscommunity.org/>`__ applications.
The Python programming language is widely used and now available on all 
High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms. It has many features that make it the
language of choice for building modular, independent tool sets. These tools can
be used to perform minuscule tasks such as movement of files within or across
systems, manipulating datetime objects, parsing and populating configuration
files, and executing and processing a series of functions in a job or a task
within an application suite. The application suites can range from a single
deterministic forecast to an ensemble of forecasts to cycled data assimilation
systems. The application suites are not just limited to a model and data
assimilation system. There are numerous examples of “workflows” in other
applications, such as observation processing and ingest, post-processing of
model and data assimilation generated data, reanalysis, verification and
validation, deployment of products and graphics to web servers.

A schematic of the vision above is shown in :numref:`Schematic_Layout_Unified_Workflow_Framework` below.

   *Schematic layout of the various components of the Unified Workflow Framework.*

The tools on the right are developed as stand-alone packages that can be
deployed independently on different platforms (like libraries). On the left
are configuration/schema files that provide the default configurations for
the workflows. These can change as the modeling systems develop. In the middle
are the workflow layers that serve different needs.

Using the tools on the right, any application can assemble a unique suite for
its needs. This allows all applications to retain similar implementations
while at the same time providing a mechanism to construct their own flavor of
the implementation.
