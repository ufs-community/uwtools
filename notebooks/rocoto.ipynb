    "The following is an example of a simple workflow written in the UW YAML language. It uses a top-level `workflow:` block that contains all other blocks in the workflow. The workflow's global attributes are set within an `attrs:` block, and each workflow has two required attributes: `realtime` and `scheduler`. The `realtime` key indicates whether the workflow will be run in realtime or in retrospective mode, where a value of `true` means that the workflow will be run in realtime mode. The `scheduler` key tells Rocoto which batch system to use when submitting and monitoring jobs. Each workflow must contain a `cycledef:` block that defines one or more sets of cycles the workflow will iterate over. A set of cycles must be given using the `spec` key. This key may define a set of cycles using either the \"start stop step\" method or the \"crontab-like\" method. The \"start stop step\" method is used below. A `log:` block is required to define the path where Rocoto logs are written. At least one task must be defined in the `tasks:` block, which is discussed in the [Tasks and Dependencies](#Tasks-and-Dependencies) section of this notebook.\n",

There are two tasks in the example below, `task_bacon` and `task_eggs`. In the Rocoto XML, two separate `<task>` tags will be created with their `name` attributes set to \"bacon\" and \"eggs\" respectively.

Each task must also contain either a `cores`, `nodes`, or `native` key to request a given number of nodes/cores used to execute the task. The `task_bacon:` block below requests 1 core, while the `task_eggs:` block requests 4 cores on 1 node.\n",

Here the `and:` block indicates that all of the individual tasks (i.e. `task_eggs`) within need to be completed. The two task dependencies must have unique names since they exist at the same level, and they are differentiated here using the `_name` suffix. To prevent circular dependencies, task dependencies must have a `task` attribute that indicates the name of a task that is already defined above it.

The values to substitute are defined in a `var:` block, and this block contains one or more keys representing the name of a list of values. The values in the list are separated by spaces. The number of tasks defined by a metatask is equal to the number of values in any list in the `var:` block. In the example below, two lists named `food` and `prepare` contain three values each, so three tasks are defined by this metatask. It is necessary that each list defined in a metatask has the same number of values. The values are referenced using the name of the list that contains the values bracketed by pound signs, as seen in the `task_#food#` key and in the following `command` string. \n",

    "`validate()` accepts <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path\">Path</a> objects or string paths passed via the `xml_file` parameter. (If `xml_file` is omitted or `None`, and `stdin_ok` is `True`, XML will be read from `stdin`, but this is a rare use case that won't be covered here.) The function returns `True` if the XML is validated without any errors, and `False` otherwise. The number of schema-validation errors, as well as details on the errors (if any), are reported.\n",
