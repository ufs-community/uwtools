"""
Basic setuptools configuration.

See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html#basic-use for
information on this standard setuptools file.

In this codebase, it is used 1. By conda-build to install the uwtools files into
the package tree, and 2. By condev-shell (called by "make devshell") to perform
an "editable" install into the conda development environment, such that source
files in the clone are live-linked into the conda environment so that they can
be executed in a context where all build/run/test dependency packages are
available.
